# 🧠 What is useMemo?
- useMemo is a React Hook that lets you memoize the result of a calculation between renders.
- Syntax and usage

```js
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => {
  return computeExpensiveValue(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
```
- computeExpensiveValue(a, b) is the function doing heavy work
- [a, b] is the dependency array — React will only re-run the function when a or b changes
- The result is cached across renders to avoid recomputation

---


# 🔁 What is useCallback?
- useCallback is a React Hook that returns a memoized version of the callback function you pass in. The function will only be recreated if one of the dependencies has changed.

- Syntax and usage
```js
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
    doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b])
```

- `() => doSomething(a, b)` is the function we want to memoize.

- `[a, b]` is the dependency array. React will return the same function reference across renders unless a or b changes.

- This helps prevent function reference changes, which can trigger unnecessary re-renders in child components (especially when using React.memo).

## 🤔 So what’s the main difference?
Let's keep it simple
- `useMemo` -> Memoizes the result of a function
- `useCallback` -> Memoizes the function itself


---


## ✅ Real-world Example: Filtering a Large List with `useMemo`
Let’s say you have a component that displays a list of users, and you want to filter only the admins. Without useMemo, this filtering will happen on every render, even if the `users` array hasn't changed.

### ❌ Without useMemo:
```js
function UserList({ users }) {
  const adminUsers = users.filter(user => user.role === 'admin');

  return (
    <ul>
      {adminUsers.map(user => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

Every time this component re-renders, it recalculates adminUsers, even if users is the same.


### ✅ With useMemo:
```js
import { useMemo } from 'react';

function UserList({ users }) {
  const adminUsers = useMemo(() => {
    return users.filter(user => user.role === 'admin');
  }, [users]);

  return (
    <ul>
      {adminUsers.map(user => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```
- users.filter(...) could be an expensive operation, especially with a large list.

- Using useMemo, React will cache the filtered result unless users changes.

- This reduces unnecessary computation and improves performance.

### ✅ Real-world Example: Preventing Unnecessary Child Re-renders with `useCallback`
Let’s say you have a Parent component that passes a click handler to a Child component. You want to make sure the Child only re-renders when it actually needs to.


### ❌ Without useCallback (function reference changes every render)

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Child = React.memo(({ onClick }) => {
  console.log('Child rendered');
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>;
});

function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked');
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase Count</button>
      <Child onClick={handleClick} />
    </>
  );
}

```

### ❗ Problem:
- `handleClick` is recreated on every render, so:

- Even though Child is wrapped in React.memo, it still re-renders.

- Console shows Child rendered every time the parent updates.

### ✅ With useCallback (stable function reference)

```js
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const Child = React.memo(({ onClick }) => {
  console.log('Child rendered');
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>;
});

function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('Button clicked');
  }, []); // no dependencies = stable reference

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase Count</button>
      <Child onClick={handleClick} />
    </>
  );
}

```

### ✅ Result:
- handleClick keeps the same reference across renders.

- Now, Child only re-renders once (unless handleClick changes).

- Console shows Child rendered only once, even as the counter updates.

## 🧾 Summary: When and Why to Use useMemo and useCallback
Both useMemo and useCallback are performance optimization tools provided by React. While they serve slightly different purposes, their ultimate goal is the same:


👉 to avoid unnecessary re-rendering and recalculations, reducing the workload on the front-end and improving app responsiveness.

- Use **useMemo** when you want to memoize the result of an expensive calculation — for example, filtering a large list or computing derived data.

- Use **useCallback** when you want to preserve the identity of a function across renders — especially useful when passing functions to memoized child components.

- By applying them thoughtfully, you can optimize your app’s performance without compromising code readability. But remember: premature optimization can sometimes be worse than no optimization — measure first, optimize second.
