# 🧠 What is useRef?
- useRef is a React Hook that returns a mutable ref object. This object has a .current property that can hold any value and persists for the entire lifetime of the component.

- Think of it as a box you can store a value in that doesn’t cause the component to re-render when it changes.


---



## 🧰 Syntax and Usage
```js
const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);
```
- `refContainer.current` holds your value (or DOM node)

- The value does not trigger re-renders when changed

- The object remains the same across renders



---


# 🔍 What Can You Do with useRef?
- ✅ 1. Access DOM Elements
- ✅ 2. Store Mutable Variables Without Causing Re-renders
- ✅ 3. Persist Previous Props or State



---

## 📦 Real-World Use Case: Clearing a Timer
```js
function Timer() {
  const timerIdRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    timerIdRef.current = setInterval(() => {
      console.log('tick');
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(timerIdRef.current);
  }, []);

  return <div>Timer is running</div>;
}

```
- You avoid stale closures and keep a stable reference to the timer ID.


---


## 🔍 Real-World Use Case: Preventing Unnecessary State Updates
```js
function ScrollTracker() {
  const lastScrollTop = useRef(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const onScroll = () => {
      const current = window.scrollY;
      if (Math.abs(current - lastScrollTop.current) > 100) {
        console.log('Scrolled 100px');
        lastScrollTop.current = current;
      }
    };

    window.addEventListener('scroll', onScroll);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', onScroll);
  }, []);

  return <p>Scroll and check console</p>;
}

```

You're storing the last scroll position without re-rendering the component.

### 🧾 Summary: When and Why to Use useRef
- Use useRef to access and interact with DOM elements.

- Use it to store variables that don’t need to trigger re-renders.

- It’s ideal for things like timers, tracking previous values, or maintaining non-visual state.

- Don’t use it for managing state that affects the UI — that’s what useState is for.
